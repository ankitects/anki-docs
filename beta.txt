= Anki 2.1 Beta =

== At a glance ==

- Uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki 2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.
- Upgraded to the latest support libraries (Python 3, Qt 5.9), bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.
- Requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux distro from around 2016+.
- Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.

== Stability ==

You can be fairly confident the beta will not eat your data. 2.1 has been in
alpha status for the last year as we waited for toolkit issues to be resolved,
and we have not had any reports of data loss during that time. It's still a
good idea to make backups however - please use File>Export to export 'all
decks' with scheduling and media included before you upgrade, and consider
doing it periodically after upgrading as well.

== Add-ons ==

Most add-ons will need to be updated before they'll work with Anki 2.1. When
you install 2.1, it will create a separate folder for add-ons, and not import
any existing ones you have installed. Some add-on authors have updated their
add-ons to work with 2.1, and updated the description on their add-on page to
mention that the add-on works in 2.1 as well.

If you're an add-on author, you can read more about the required changes on
https://github.com/dae/anki/blob/master/README.addons

== Problems ==

If you run into any issues, please let us know on the beta testing section of
our support site:
