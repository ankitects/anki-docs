_ Writing Anki 2.0 Add-ons _

= Translations =

 * 日本語: http://rightstuff.luminousspice.com/2012/09/anki2addons/

= Overview =

Anki is written in a user-friendly language called Python. If you're not
familiar with Python, please read the http://docs.python.org/tutorial/[Python
tutorial] before proceeding with the rest of this document.

Because Python is a dynamic language, add-ons are extremely powerful in Anki -
not only can they extend the program, but they can also modify arbitrary
aspects of it, such as altering the way scheduling works, modifying the UI,
and so on.

Anki is comprised of two parts: 

'libanki' contains all the "backend" code - opening collections, fetching and
answering cards, and so on. It is used by Anki's GUI, and can also be included
in command line programs to access Anki decks without the GUI.

'ankiqt' contains the UI part of Anki. Anki's UI is built upon PyQt, Python
bindings for the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt. PyQt follows Qt's API very
closely, so the http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/index.html[Qt documentation] can
be very useful when you want to know how to use a particular GUI component.

No special development environment is required to develop plugins. All you
need is a text editor. While you can write plugins in a simple text editor
like notepad, you may want to look into an editor that can provide syntax
highlighting (colouring of the code) to make things easier.

When Anki starts up, it checks for .py files in the Documents/Anki/addons
folder, and runs each one it finds. When add-ons are run, they typically
modify existing code or add new menu items to provide a new feature.

= A Simple Add-On =

Add the following to a test.py file in your add-ons folder:

-----
# import the main window object (mw) from ankiqt
from aqt import mw
# import the "show info" tool from utils.py
from aqt.utils import showInfo
# import all of the Qt GUI library
from aqt.qt import *

# We're going to add a menu item below. First we want to create a function to
# be called when the menu item is activated.

def testFunction():
    # get the number of cards in the current collection, which is stored in
    # the main window
    cardCount = mw.col.cardCount()
    # show a message box
    showInfo("Card count: %d" % cardCount)

# create a new menu item, "test"
action = QAction("test", mw)
# set it to call testFunction when it's clicked
mw.connect(action, SIGNAL("triggered()"), testFunction)
# and add it to the tools menu
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
-----

Restart Anki, and you should find a 'test' item in the tools menu. Running it
will display a dialog with the card count.

If you make a mistake when entering in the plugin, Anki will show an error
message on startup indicating where the problem is.

= The Collection =

All operations on a collection file are accessed via mw.col. Some basic
examples of what you can do:

*Get a due card:*

-----
card = mw.col.sched.getCard()
if not card:
    # current deck is finished
-----

*Answer the card:*

-----
mw.col.sched.answerCard(card, ease)
-----

*Edit a note (append " new" to the end of each field):*

-----
note = card.note()
for (name, value) in note.items():
    note[name] = value + " new"
note.flush()
-----

*Get card IDs for notes with tag x:*

-----
ids = mw.col.findCards("tag:x")
-----

*Get question and answer for each of those ids:*

-----
for id in ids:
    card = mw.col.getCard(id)    
    question = card.q()
    answer = card.a()
-----

*Reset the scheduler after any DB changes. Note that we call reset() on the
main window, since the GUI has to be updated as well:*

-----
mw.reset()
-----

*Import a text file into the collection*

-----
from anki.importing import TextImporter
file = open("/path/to/text.txt")
# change to the basic note type
m = mw.col.models.byName("Basic")
mw.col.models.setCurrent(m)
# set 'Import' as the target deck
m['did'] = mw.col.decks.id("Import")
mw.col.models.save(m)
# import into the collection
ti = TextImporter(mw.col, file)
ti.initMapping()
ti.run()
-----
    
Almost every GUI operation has an associated function in libanki, so any of
the operations that Anki makes available can also be called in an add-on.

If you want to access the collection outside of the GUI, you can do so with
the following code:

-----
from anki import Collection
col = Collection("/path/to/collection.anki2")
-----

= The Database =

When you need to perform operations that are not already supported by libanki,
you can access the database directly. Anki collections are stored in SQLite
files. Please see the http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html[SQLite documentation]
for more information.

Anki's DB object supports the following functions:

*execute() allows you to perform an insert or update operation. Use named
arguments with ?. eg:*

-----
mw.col.db.execute("update cards set ivl = ? where id = ?", newIvl, cardId)
-----

*executemany() allows you to perform bulk update or insert operations. For
large updates, this is much faster than calling execute() for each data point.
eg:*

-----
data = [[newIvl1, cardId1], [newIvl2, cardId2]]
mw.col.db.executemany(same_sql_as_above, data)
-----

*scalar() returns a single item:*

-----
showInfo("card count: %d" % mw.col.db.scalar("select count() from cards"))
-----

*list() returns a list of the first column in each row, eg [1, 2, 3]:*

-----
ids = mw.col.db.list("select id from cards limit 3")
-----

*all() returns a list of rows, where each row is a list:*

-----
ids_and_ivl = mw.col.db.all("select id, ivl from cards")
-----

*execute() can also be used to iterate over a result set without building an
intermediate list. eg:*

-----
for id, ivl in mw.col.db.execute("select id, ivl from cards limit 3"):
    showInfo("card id %d has ivl %d" % (id, ivl))
-----

Note that add-ons should never modify the tables in a collection, as that may
break future versions of Anki. If you need to store plugin-specific data,
please create a new table that is unlikely to conflict, or store the data in a
separate file. For small configuration options, they can be stored within
mw.col.conf, but please don't store large amounts of data there as it's copied
on every sync.

= Hooks =

Hooks have been added to a few parts of the code to make writing add-ons
easier. There are two types: 'hooks' take some arguments and return no value,
and 'filters' take a value and return it (perhaps modified).

A simple example of the former is in the leech handling. When the scheduler
(libanki/sched.py) discovers a leech, it calls:

-----
runHook("leech", card)
-----

If you wished to perform a special operation when a leech was discovered, such
as moving the card to a "Difficult" deck, you could do it with the following
code:

-----
from anki.hooks import addHook
from aqt.mw import mw

def onLeech(card):
    # can modify without .flush(), as scheduler will do it for us
    card.did = mw.col.decks.id("Difficult")
    # if the card was in a cram deck, we have to put back the original due
    # time and original deck
    card.odid = 0
    if card.odue:
        card.due = card.odue
        card.odue = 0

addHook("leech", onLeech)
-----

An example of a filter is in aqt/editor.py. The editor calls the
"editFocusLost" filter each time a field loses focus, so that add-ons can
apply changes to the note:

-----
if runFilter(
    "editFocusLost", False, self.note, self.currentField):
    # something updated the note; schedule reload
    def onUpdate():
        self.loadNote()
        self.checkValid()
    self.mw.progress.timer(100, onUpdate, False)
-----

Each filter accepts three arguments: a modified flag, the note, and the
current field. If a filter makes no changes it returns the modified flag the
same as it received it; if it makes a change it returns True. In this way, if
any single add-on makes a change, the UI will reload the note to show updates.

The Japanese Support add-on uses this hook to automatically generate one field
from another. A slightly simplified version is presented below:

-----
def onFocusLost(flag, n, fidx):
    from aqt import mw
    # japanese model?
    if "japanese" not in n.model()['name'].lower():
        return flag
    # have src and dst fields?
    for c, name in enumerate(mw.col.models.fieldNames(n.model())):
        for f in srcFields:
            if name == f:
                src = f
                srcIdx = c
        for f in dstFields:
            if name == f:
                dst = f
    if not src or not dst:
        return flag
    # dst field already filled?
    if n[dst]:
        return flag
    # event coming from src field?
    if fidx != srcIdx:
        return flag
    # grab source text
    srcTxt = mw.col.media.strip(n[src])
    if not srcTxt:
        return flag
    # update field
    try:
        n[dst] = mecab.reading(srcTxt)
    except Exception, e:
        mecab = None
        raise
    return True
    
addHook('editFocusLost', onFocusLost)
-----

The first argument of a filter is the argument that should be returned. In the
focus lost filter this is a flag, but in other cases it may be some other
object. For example, in libanki/collection.py, _renderQA() calls the "mungeQA"
filter which contains the generated HTML for the front and back of cards.
latex.py uses this filter to convert text in LaTeX tags into images.

= Monkey Patching and Method Wrapping =

If you want to modify a function that doesn't already have a hook, it's
possible to overwrite that function with a custom version instead. This is
sometimes referred to as 'monkey patching'.

In aqt/editor.py there is a function setupButtons() which creates the buttons
like bold, italics and so on that you see in the editor. Let's imagine you
want to add another button in your add-on.

The simplest way is to copy and paste the function from the Anki source code,
add your text to the bottom, and then overwrite the original, like so:

-----
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self):
    <copy & pasted code from original>
    <custom add-on code>
    
Editor.setupButtons = mySetupButtons
-----
    
This approach is fragile however, as if the original code is updated in a
future version of Anki, you would also have to update your add-on. A better
approach would be to save the original, and call it in our custom version:

-----
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self):
    origSetupButtons(self)
    <custom add-on code>
    
origSetupButtons = Editor.setupButtons
Editor.setupButtons = mySetupButtons
-----

Because this is a common operation, Anki provides a function called wrap()
which makes this a little more convenient. A real example:

-----
from anki.hooks import wrap
from aqt.editor import Editor
from aqt.utils import showInfo
    
def buttonPressed(self):
    showInfo("pressed " + `self`)    

def mySetupButtons(self):
    # - size=False tells Anki not to use a small button
    # - the lambda is necessary to pass the editor instance to the
    #   callback, as we're passing in a function rather than a bound
    #   method
    self._addButton("mybutton", lambda s=self: buttonPressed(self),
                    text="PressMe", size=False)
    
Editor.setupButtons = wrap(Editor.setupButtons, mySetupButtons)
-----

By default, wrap() runs your custom code after the original code. You can pass
a third argument, "before", to reverse this. If you need to run code both
before and after the original version, you can do so like so:

-----
from anki.hooks import wrap
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self, _old):
    <before code>
    ret = _old(self)
    <after code>
    return ret
    
Editor.setupButtons = wrap(Editor.setupButtons, mySetupButtons, "around")
-----

If you need to modify the middle of a function rather than run code before or
after it, there may a good argument for adding a hook to that function in the
original code. In these situations, please post on the forum and ask for a
hook to be added.

= Qt =

As mentioned above, the http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/index.html[Qt
documentation] is invaluable for learning how to display different GUI
widgets.

One particular thing to bear in mind is that objects are garbage collected in
Python, so if you do something like:

-----
def myfunc():
    widget = QWidget()
    widget.show()
-----

...then the widget will disappear as soon as the function exits. To prevent
this, assign top level widgets to an existing object, like:

-----
def myfunc():
    mw.myWidget = widget = QWidget()
    widget.show()
-----
        
= Standard Modules =

Anki ships with only the standard modules necessary to run the program - a
full copy of Python is not included. For that reason, if you need to use a
standard module that is not included with Anki, you'll need to bundle it with
your add-on.

= Debugging =

If your code throws an exception, it will be caught by Anki's standard
exception handler (which catches anything written to stderr). If you need to
print information for debugging purposes, you can use aqt.utils.showInfo, or
write it to stderr with sys.stderr.write("text\n").

Anki also includes a REPL. From within the program, press Ctrl+: or Command+:
and a window will open up. You can enter expressions or statements into the
top area, and then press ctrl+return/command+return to evaluate them. An
example session follows:

-----
>>> mw
<no output>

>>> print mw
<aqt.main.AnkiQt object at 0x10c0ddc20>

>>> invalidName
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/dae/Lib/anki/qt/aqt/main.py", line 933, in onDebugRet
    exec text
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'invalidName' is not defined

>>> a = [a for a in dir(mw.form) if a.startswith("action")]
... print a
... print
... pp(a)
['actionAbout', 'actionCheckMediaDatabase', ...]

['actionAbout',
 'actionCheckMediaDatabase',
 'actionDocumentation',
 'actionDonate',
 ...]

>>> pp(mw.reviewer.card)
<anki.cards.Card object at 0x112181150>

>>> pp(card()) # shortcut for mw.reviewer.card.__dict__
{'_note': <anki.notes.Note object at 0x11221da90>,
 '_qa': [...]
 'col': <anki.collection._Collection object at 0x1122415d0>,
 'data': u'',
 'did': 1,
 'due': -1,
 'factor': 2350,
 'flags': 0,
 'id': 1307820012852L,
 [...]
}

>>> pp(bcard()) # shortcut for selected card in browser
<as above>
-----

Note that you need to explicitly print an expression in order to see what it
evaluates to. Anki exports pp() (pretty print) in the scope to make it easier
to quickly dump the details of objects, and the shortcut ctrl+shift+return
will wrap the current text in the upper area with pp() and execute the result.

If you're on Linux or are running Anki from source, it's also possible to
debug your script with pdb. Place the following line somewhere in your code,
and when Anki reaches that point it will kick into the debugger in the
terminal:

-----
from aqt.qt import debug; debug()
-----

Alternatively you can export DEBUG=1 in your shell and it will kick into the
debugger on an uncaught exception.

= Learning More =

Both libanki and ankiqt are available at http://github.com/dae/. The
colllection object is defined in libanki's collection.py. Other useful files
to check out are cards.py, notes.py, sched.py, models.py and decks.py.

It can also be helpful to look in the ankiqt source to see how it's calling
libanki for a particular operation, or to learn more about the GUI.

Much of the GUI is defined in designer files. You can use the Qt Designer
program to open the .ui files and browse the GUI in a convenient way. 

And finally, it can also be extremely helpful to browse other add-ons to see
how they accomplish something.

= Porting Anki 1.2 plugins =

Some of the main changes to be aware of:

 * Table changes: facts->notes, reviewHistory->revlog
 * Fields are stored in the notes tables now, in a single text field 'flds'.
   The fields are separated by \x1f.
 * There's no cardTags table now. Use col.findCards("tag:x note:y card:z") to
   search in a similar way to before.
 * The scheduling code is all in sched.py; the deck code is now in
   collection.py.
 * If you do bulk updates of the notes table and don't use findReplace(), make
   sure to call col.updateFieldCache()
 * There's no Q/A cache anymore, so you can't search for text in the card
   question or answer without generating it first.
 * Instead of the old undo system, call mw.checkpoint("Undo Name") to save the
   collection before you make changes. If the user undoes the operation, it
   will revert back to the saved state.
 * In order to ensure changes sync, if you modify notes or cards in the DB,
   make sure you update mod and set usn to col.usn().
 * Likewise, when you modify models or decks, make sure to call save() in the
   relevant manager.
 * If you set up a timer, use mw.progress.timer() to ensure the timer doesn't
   fire in the middle of a DB operation.
 * There's no stats table anymore, since it can't be merged when syncing. The
   statistics now need to be derived from the revlog table.

= Sharing Add-ons =

For a simple one-file add-on, you can upload the .py file. For multi-file
add-ons, please create a subfolder that acts as a Python package, and create a
small .py file that imports that package. Using the Japanese support add-on as
an example, the structure looks like:

  japanese/file1.py
  japanese/file2.py
  japanese/__init__.py # can be empty; marks the folder as a package
  japanese/<binary support files>
  jp.py

To upload a multi-file add-on, please zip up the folder and the loader .py
file and upload the zip.

Please upload add-ons to https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/
