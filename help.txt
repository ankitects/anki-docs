= Before Asking =

Before asking for help, please have a look in the manual. The top of the
manual provides some links to some short intro videos that address some common
topics.

 * link:/docs/manual.html[User Manual]
 * link:/docs/manual.html#_intro_videos[Short Intro Videos]

If the intro videos do not address your issue, please try searching the manual
with your browser's find command (Ctrl+F, or on a Mac, Command+F).

If you were unable to find what you needed in the manual, have a bug report or
a suggestion, please visit the relevant site:

 * https://anki.tenderapp.com/[Computers, AnkiWeb, Apple Devices, Add-Ons and Effective Learning]
 * https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html[Android Devices]

Please don't forget to be polite! We understand it can be frustrating when you
can't find what you're looking for quickly, but please resist the temptation
to take out your frustration on us. The majority of the questions we answer
are from people who have not contributed to Anki, so it is mostly volunteer
work. As the adage goes, "you can catch more flies with honey than with
vinegar", and if you're polite and courteous, we're much more likely to answer
your questions or go the extra mile to help you out.
